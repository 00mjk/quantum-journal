# LaTeX document class for Quantum

This is version 5.0 of `quantumarticle`, the document class for typsetting articles in Quantum - the open journal for quantum science.

[Click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quantum-journal/quantum-journal/master/quantumarticle.cls) to download the latest stable version.

[More information](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quantum-journal/quantum-journal/master/quantum-template.pdf) on using quantumarticle and on typesetting manuscripts for Quantum can be found in the accompanying template.

[Documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quantum-journal/quantum-journal/master/quantumarticle.pdf) of all class options is also provided. 


## Installation and usage

To use the `quantumarticle` document class with LaTeX simply start your document with the line:

```latex
\documentclass[your options]{quantumarticle}

```
Before you can do this however, you must make `quantumarticle.cls` accessible to your LaTeX compiler. You have several options for doing this:

1. The `quantumarticle` class is provided with install scripts for bash and PowerShell. These scripts should work for Windows 7 or later with MiKTeX, or for TeX Live with Linux or macOS / OS X. To install the class into your user-local LaTeX directory you would first clone this git repository `git clone https://github.com/quantum-journal/quantum-journal.git quantum-journal` and them from within bash execute:
 ```bash
 $ cd quantum-journal/
 $ ./install.sh
 ```
 Similarly, under PowerShell:
 ```powershell
 PS > cd quantum-journal/
 PS > ./install.ps1
 ```

2. Alternatively you can use `quantumarticle.cls` without installing it by simply downloading it directly via [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quantum-journal/quantum-journal/master/quantumarticle.cls) and putting it in the same folder as your main LaTeX source file. This can be the most convenient option if you are working on a manuscript together with collaborators that do not want to install `quantumarticle.cls` and are exchanging the source files of your manuscript via email or cloud storage services. When you upload your manuscript to the arXiv you will anyway have to include `quantumarticle.cls` along with other source files.

3. To manually install `quantumarticle`, you can either clone this git repository or download `quantumarticle.cls` directly via [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quantum-journal/quantum-journal/master/quantumarticle.cls) and then copy the `quantumarticle.cls` file to `texmf/tex/latex/quantumarticle` within your home directory (under Linux, macOS, and OS X `~/`, or under Windows typically `C:\Users\[your username]`) and run `texhash` (TeX Live) or `initexmf --update-fndb` (MiKTeX).

4. Finally, you can use `quantumarticle.cls` without even downloading it at all on the collaborative writing platform [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) by starting your project from the `quantumarticle` [template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submission-to-quantum-journal/gsjgyhxrtrzy) as well as with the [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/project) online LaTeX editor by using the `quantumarticle` [template](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/5912bce26aad110026f11697) there.

## Dependencies

`quantumarticle.cls` should work with any reasonably recent LaTeX distribution. It further requires the following packages: `xkeyval`, `etoolbox`, `geometry`, `xcolor`, `fancyhdr`, `tikz`, `hyperref`, ltxgrid and ltxcmds (often distributed along with revtex, in texlive for example as part of `texlive-publishers`), as well as at least either `lmodern` or `type1ec`. We recommend to have `natbib` and at least one of `bbm` or `dsfont` installed. All of these should be included in the full install variant of your LaTeX distribution (for example `texlive-full`).

## Compatibility

The `quantumarticle` class tries to be **maximally compatible** with existing document classes, such as, `article`, `revtex`, `iopart`, and `elsarticle`. It supports all standard options, like `twocolumn`, `onecolumn`, `titlepage`, as well as the standard syntax for defining the title page with the `\author`, `\address`, and `\affiliation` commands and the `abstract` environment.

## Beta features

In addition, this document class come bundled with two new extras (currently in beta phase):

1. The quantum-plots.ipynb Jupyter notebook and matplotlib style for effortlessly producing professional looking plots in python.

2. The quantum-lyx-template.lyx LxY style, which allow you to generate the LaTeX source of your quantumarticle manuscript with the LyX document processor.

## Changelog

### New in v5.0:

* force users to specify a paper size to prevent unexpected behavior
* option processing is now done exclusively by means of xkeyval
* improved compatibility with frequently used latey document classes
* improved/added options for using this documentclass for manuscripts not intended for submission to Quantum
* use https in links when possible
* prevent usage of the \today makro in \date to avoid changing dates in documents when they are re-compiled on the arXiv
* enforce \pdfoutput=1 (as recommended by the arXiv) to prevent problems with multi-line hyper links
* improved error messages
* fxed a bug that lead to the title not beeing centered with the titlepage option

In case you encounter problems using the article class please consider opening a bug report in our [bug-tracker on github](https://github.com/cgogolin/quantum-journal/issues).
You can also contact us via email under latex@quantum-journal.org, but it may take significantly longer to get a response.
In any case we need the full source of a document that produces the problem and the log file showing the error to help you.

Improvements submitted as pull requests against the `development` branch are very much appreciated!
